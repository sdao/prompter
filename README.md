Web-based teleprompter with controller panel and mirrored presentation panel

This is a teleprompter app that is designed to be used with a multi-monitor setup.
The primary monitor displays the correctly-oriented text for an operator to control.
The secondary monitor displays a flipped image that is projected into the prompter screen mounted below the camera.

This app displays two windows -- the operator controls and the output screen, which is mirrored.
As the operator controls the text, the two windows scroll in synch.
